# Goalsetter – MERN Stack Goal Tracking App

Goalsetter is a full-stack web application that allows users to register, log in, and manage personal goals. It’s built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and uses Redux Toolkit for frontend state management.

Once logged in, users can:
	•	Create, update, and delete goals
	•	View a list of their goals
	•	Secure their data via JWT-protected API routes
